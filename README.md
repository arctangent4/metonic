a calculator for metonic cycles between moons and planets

Welcome to the metonic cycle calculator. This will calculate the length of an approximate metonic cycle for any planet and respective moon. 
Then, you can ask find all dates where the sun, the planet, and its moon are in the same configuration relative to each other. But keep in mind that shifts in planetary
orbits and calculation error make our approximation rough. The most famous use of a metonic cycle calculation is to find
future dates of Easter--as the holiday has to occur on the Sunday that follows the first full full moon after March 21st(the spring equinox).
